# Metabase Peaka Driver

## Driver Plugin Installation

The Peaka Driver `.jar` binary can be downloaded from our releases in github. Once it is downloaded,
it must be stored in the `plugins` directory within the Metabase working dir. See: https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/developers-guide-drivers.html#how-to-use-a-third-party-driver

### Building

Run `make build` to clone the Metabase repo and build all required components. This command should not need
to be run again unless you manually git pull new changes into your local Metabase repo.
